# Order Status Helper

Summarize an order object for a support dashboard. The final summary should expose payment status, shipping status, item count, and whether the order needs attention.

Write these functions:

- `isPaid(order)` should return true when payment.status is "paid".
- `hasShipped(order)` should return true when shipping.status is "shipped".
- `getDeliveryMessage(order)` should return a shipping message and include estimatedDelivery when the order has shipped.
- `needsAttention(order)` should return true when the order is unpaid or has not shipped.
- `createOrderSummary(order)` should return id, customerName, paid, shipped, itemCount, deliveryMessage, and needsAttention.

Sample checks:

```js
const order = {
  id: "ORD-1001",
  customer: {
    name: "Ava Stone",
    email: "ava@example.com",
  },
  payment: {
    status: "paid",
  },
  shipping: {
    status: "shipped",
    estimatedDelivery: "2026-06-18",
  },
  items: [
    { name: "Notebook", quantity: 2 },
    { name: "Pen Set", quantity: 1 },
  ],
};

console.log(createOrderSummary(order));
console.log(isPaid(order));
console.log(hasShipped(order));

const pendingOrder = {
  ...order,
  payment: { status: "unpaid" },
  shipping: { status: "processing", estimatedDelivery: "2026-06-18" },
};
console.log(needsAttention(pendingOrder));
console.log(getDeliveryMessage(pendingOrder));
```

Expected outputs:

```txt
{ id: "ORD-1001", customerName: "Ava Stone", paid: true, shipped: true, itemCount: 3, deliveryMessage: "Order shipped. Estimated delivery: 2026-06-18.", needsAttention: false }
true
true
true
Order has not shipped yet.
```
